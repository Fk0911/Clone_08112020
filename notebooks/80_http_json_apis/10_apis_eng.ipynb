    "# (Web)-APIs\n",
    "According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface), an API is defined as follows:\n",
    "> An **application programming interface (API)** is an *interface* or *communication protocol* between \n",
    "> different parts of a *computer program* intended to simplify the implementation and maintenance of software.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> An API may be for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware, or software library. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, APIs **provide stable interfaces** to access and **abstract** functions implementation details of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions are stable against changes. I.e. they are available in different Python versions and always provide the same functionality.\n",
    "They are also abstract from their implementation.\n",
    "When using the `print` function, it does not matter whether the Python program is executed under Windows, Mac OS, or Linux.\n",
    "The text is always displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples of web-based APIs\n",
    "You also implicitly use a variety of Web APIs every day:\n",
    "- Facebook and Instagram APIs\n",
    "- Amazon APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "## History of web-based APIs\n",
    "In the past 20 years, web-based APIs have grown enormously in popularity.\n",
    "The following graphic shows an excerpt from the development of web-based APIs\n",
    "![api_history.png](./img/api_history.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In January 2020, the website [Programmable Web](https://www.programmableweb.com/category/all/apis) lists around 22,350 publicly available web-based APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do companies publish their APIs?\n",
    "What motivates companies like Twitter, Facebook, Google, or Netflix to publish their APIs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Expedia\n",
    "Expedia's [API](https://www.programmableweb.com/api/expedia-partner-solutions-rapid-booking) provides access to\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ticketing\n",
    "- Photos\n",
    "- Search results\n",
    "- Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the core functions of Expedia!\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2018, Expedia generated sales of $ 11.2 billion. In the past, 90% of this revenue was generated via the API!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Netflix\n",
    "The following numbers refer to the use of the Netflix API in 2011 ([source](https://www.slideshare.net/danieljacobson/redesigning-the-netflix-api-oscon)).\n",
    "\n",
    "- 20,000 developers\n",
    "- 13,000 registered apps\n",
    "- 800+ device types\n",
    "- 1 billion API calls / day\n",
    "- Up to 20,000 API calls per second\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these numbers, you can make a small naive calculation:\n",
    "$$10.000 \\times 50.000 \\frac{ \\text{US\\$}}{\\text{Year}}= 500.000.000\\frac{\\text{US\\$}}{\\text{Year}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### What options do web-based APIs offer?\n",
    "Here's a nice example on the website of [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building web-based APIs\n",
    "There are no standards for web-based APIs. The following technologies are currently the most widespread:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [REST](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer)\n",
    "- [GraphQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL).  \n",
    "\n",
    "REST is discussed in more detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.\n",
    "It is an architectural concept for distributed systems that was developed by [Roy Fielding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding) in his [dissertation](www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/ top.htm).\n",
    "REST is based on the following building blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Resources are identified by URLs. Example: http://api.example.com/resources\n",
    "- An Internet Media Type is used to define the possible status changes of the resource (in the simplest case a link)\n",
    "- The methods defined in the HTTP protocol (e.g. GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE) are used to access resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "No data format is explicitly specified in connection with REST.\n",
    "The data of the resources can be processed in various data formats.\n",
    "Which formats are supported depends on the respective service or API.\n",
    "Currently, [JSON](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_Object_Notation) is a very widespread data format for web-based APIS."
